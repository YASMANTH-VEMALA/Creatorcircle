# Suggested People Algorithm

## How It Works

The suggested people feature now works exactly as requested:

### Example Scenario:
- **You have**: 3 skills + 3 interests = 6 total items
- **Other person has**: 5 skills + 2 interests = 7 total items

### Matching Logic:
1. **Combine all items**: Your total (6) vs Their total (7)
2. **Find any match**: If ANY item from your 6 matches ANY item from their 7
3. **Include as suggestion**: They become a suggested person

### Match Types:
- **Direct Skills**: Your skill matches their skill
- **Direct Interests**: Your interest matches their interest  
- **Cross Skills→Interests**: Your skill matches their interest
- **Cross Interests→Skills**: Your interest matches their skill

### Example:
```
Your Profile:
- Skills: ["React", "JavaScript", "Python"]
- Interests: ["AI", "Web Dev", "Data Science"]

Other Person:
- Skills: ["Vue.js", "JavaScript", "Node.js", "MongoDB", "Express"]
- Interests: ["Web Dev", "Mobile Apps"]

Matches Found:
- Direct Skills: "JavaScript" (1 match)
- Direct Interests: "Web Dev" (1 match)
- Cross Skills→Interests: "JavaScript" → "Web Dev" (1 match)
- Cross Interests→Skills: "Web Dev" → "JavaScript" (1 match)

Total Matches: 4
Match Score: 4/6 = 0.67 (67% match)
```

### Result:
✅ **This person will be suggested** because they have at least 1 match from your total 6 items.

## Benefits:
- **More inclusive**: Shows more relevant people
- **Better matching**: Considers all possible connections
- **Higher quality**: People with any shared interest/skill
- **Flexible**: Works with any number of skills/interests
