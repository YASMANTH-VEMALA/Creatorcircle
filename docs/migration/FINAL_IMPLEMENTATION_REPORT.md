   - Input validation
   - Business logic
   - Error handling
   - Logging
   - Consistent response format

### Routes (15 files)
All routes properly configured with:
- Express Router
- Authentication middleware where needed
- Proper HTTP methods
- RESTful design
- All registered in server.ts

### Documentation (Multiple files)
- ✅ COMPLETE_API_ENDPOINTS.md - Full API reference

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### File Upload (Placeholder)
The upload endpoints are placeholders. In production, integrate with:
- AWS S3
- Firebase Storage
- Cloudinary
- Or similar cloud storage service

### Search (Basic Implementation)
Current search uses MongoDB regex. For production:
- Consider Elasticsearch
- Or MongoDB Atlas Search
- For better performance and features

### Admin Routes
Report and moderation endpoints need admin role checking.
Add admin middleware when user roles are implemented.
