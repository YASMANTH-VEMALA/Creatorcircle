## Implementation Strategy

Due to the large number of endpoints (67 remaining), I'll create them in **3 phases**:

### Phase 1: High Priority Social Features (21 endpoints)
1. Spotlight Posts (9)
2. Notification System (6)
3. Follow Suggestions (2)
4. Share APIs (2)
5. XP/Gamification (4 - for existing gamification in mobile app)

### Phase 2: Real-time Communication (27 endpoints)
6. Chat/Messaging (11)
7. Message APIs (5)
8. Room/Community (8)
9. Room Messages (3)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (19 endpoints)
10. Collaboration Requests (5)
11. Location Services (4)
12. Report System (5)
13. File Upload (4)
14. Search (4)

##  Approach

Given the scope, I'll:
1. **Create comprehensive controller generation scripts** for each category
2. **Generate all controllers** with proper validation, error handling, and logging
3. **Create all route files** linking to the new controllers
4. **Update main routes** to include all new endpoints
5. **Compile and test** to ensure everything works

## Estimated Time

- **Phase 1**: ~15-20 minutes (21 endpoints)
- **Phase 2**: ~20-25 minutes (27 endpoints)
- **Phase 3**: ~15-20 minutes (19 endpoints)

**Total**: ~50-65 minutes for all 67 endpoints

## Would you like me to:

**Option A**: Create ALL 67 endpoints now (comprehensive, takes time)
**Option B**: Create Phase 1 first (21 high-priority endpoints), then continue
**Option C**: Focus on specific categories you need most urgently

Please let me know your preference!
